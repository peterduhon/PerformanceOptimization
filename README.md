# Performance Optimization in AdTech Bidding

## Overview

This project demonstrates performance optimization techniques within a simulated real-time bidding environment, a critical aspect of AdTech where every millisecond counts. The code showcases how to improve the execution speed of bidding operations using parallel processing.

## Key Features

- **Simulated Bidding Environment**: Generates random bid amounts from various advertisers with simulated network latency to replicate real-world bidding scenarios.
- **Performance Profiling**: Compares the execution time of unoptimized vs. optimized code to identify bottlenecks and measure improvements.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` to execute bidding operations concurrently, significantly reducing execution time.

## Files

- `optimize_bidding.py`: The main script containing both the unoptimized and optimized bidding simulations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

1. **Unoptimized Version**: Simulates bidding operations in a sequential manner.
2. **Optimized Version**: Implements parallel processing to speed up bidding operations.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `optimize_bidding.py` script.
3. Compare the execution times of the unoptimized and optimized versions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PerformanceOptimization.git
cd PerformanceOptimization
python optimize_bidding.py
```
